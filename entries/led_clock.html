  This is a clock I designed, built, and programmed. It uses a Raspberry Pi,
  Arduino Uno, and 10 8x8 LED matrices, which are controlled by MAX7219 chips.
</p>
<h2>(Almost) Final Result</h2>
  <p>
    The code is 
    <a href="https://github.com/claytonketner/clockpi">
      on github</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is still a project I'm working on, but here's the latest:

    I designed the number font myself because I wanted it to look good.
  </p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
  <p>
    I found these LED arrays on ebay for about $1.50 each. Each one was the 8x8
    red LED array, a control board that uses a MAX7219, and header pins. I
    bought 10 with the idea that I would make a 3x3 or a 2x5 array clock.
  </p>

<h2>Controlling the LEDs</h2>
  <p>
    I found an Arduino library that can control the MAX7219's, so I decided to
    use an Arduino to control the LEDs and a Raspberry Pi to easily connect to
    the internet to know what time it is, check the weather, look at my
    calendar, or anything else I would think up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, I didn't think of looking for a MAX7219 library for the
    Raspberry Pi, which would allow me to cut out the Arduino middle-man. Oops.
  </p>

<h2>Hardware Mounting</h2>
  <p>
    I mounted everything on a plastic board, so that I could easily mount it on
    a wall. I wanted all the components to be centered vertically. I also
    wanted as few wires showing as possible. To accomplish that, I designed
    everything so that wires would pass through the back board and live behind
    it, coming up behind the boards.

    Everything mounted - the boards and LEDs are all centered nicely.
  "/>
  <p>
    I also designed and 3D printed some over-engineered mounts for the Arduino
    and RPi that stand them off from the back board so that I could route
    wires up from below to keep the look clean.
  </p>

    The 3D printed Arduino and RPi mounts I designed hold them up so that wires
    can be routed up beneath them so that there are no messy wires showing.

  <p>
    The LED control boards are daisy-chainable, but the pitch between the pins
    makes it impossible to mount them side by side on a breadboard. To get
    around this annoying design flaw, I had to hack up a unique mounting
    solution. Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures showing my solution,
    but it mostly involves an intermediate mounting plate - it's the orange
    part below the LEDs in the pictures.

<h2>Software</h2>
  <p>
    I implemented everything as simply as possible at first, and then optimized
    later. This meant I could also see the worst implementation runtime and the
    best. The results of this can be seen in
    <a href="https://github.com/claytonketner/clockpi">
      the README on github
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a video of when I first got the clock working and showing the time
    (it was late at night - about 2:25 AM).

  <h3>Benchmark</h3>
  <p>
    I also devised a benchmark so that I could put a number on the performance
    of the clock. The number doesn't mean much, but is useful for comparing
    the unoptimized vs. optimized software. The benchmark consists of the RPi
    telling the Arduino what to do over serial, and the Arduino displaying it
    on the LEDs. The benchmark consists of displaying 3 screens:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>All LEDs lit</li>
    <li>The numbers 0-4 side by side</li>
    <li>The numbers 5-9 side by side</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Unoptimized Benchmark</h3>
  <p>
    Here's the first (unoptimized software) benchmark run - it takes about 30.7
    seconds to run! You can see the delay between screen changes, which is due
    to slowness in the communication between the RPi and the Arduino. You can
    also see the changes sweep across the display, which is due to the slowness
    of the Arduino communicating with the MAX7219 chips. Fortunately, both of
    these issues were optimizable!

  <h3>Optimized Benchmark</h3>
  <p>
    And here's the optimized software benchmark (don't blink!) - it only takes
    1.0 second to run! Here, the cycle time to update the display is about 0.38
    seconds. The fact that this cycle time is sub-second is why I'm able to
    have the clock display seconds.
