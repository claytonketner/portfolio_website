    I'm a mechanical engineer and software developer.
    I like to use my mechanical design and software skills together to build
    cool things that help people and the earth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I'm working at Counsyl as an Automation Engineer where I've
    done a lot of the mechanical design for many parts in their robotic
    workcell. I'm the main mechanical design engineer, so I had all the
    decision making power for all my design projects, which was a fun
    experience. Here's a video that WIRED did of Counsyl's lab:

    You can see some parts that I've designed:

  <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
    <h3>0:16</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The nests that the 6-axis Staubli arm picks the green plate from
      </li>
      <li>
        These nests are used everywhere in the workcell
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
    <h3>0:16, 0:32, et al</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The fingers on the six-axis Staubli arms
      </li>
      <li>
        They're that funny shape so that they can fit into all the instruments
      </li>
      <li>
        They also have that large rib on the inside to make them very stiff
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
    <h3>0:32</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The back of my head!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
    <h3>0:44</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Side loading liquid handler nests
      </li>
      <li>
        We needed to load these instruments from the side, so I had to get
        creative with the existing threaded holes already on the instrument to
        attach these custom side loading nests
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    I've designed way more than that at Counsyl, but can't show it off due to
    my NDA.
