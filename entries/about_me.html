    Right now, I'm working at Counsyl as an Automation Engineer where I've
    done a lot of the mechanical design for many parts in their robotic
    workcell. I'm the main mechanical design engineer, so I had all the
    decision making power for all my design projects, which was a fun
    experience. Here's a video that WIRED did of Counsyl's lab:

    You can see some parts that I've designed:

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:16</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The nests that the 6-axis Staubli arm picks the green plate from
        </li>
        <li>
          These nests are used everywhere in the workcell
        </li>
        <li>
          The clearance (or wiggle room) of a plate in this nest is less than the
          chamfer size so that, given two nests with centered teach points, the
          plate will always sit properly in the nest after a move
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:16, 0:32, et al</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The fingers on the six-axis Staubli arms
        </li>
        <li>
          They're that funny shape so that they can fit into all the
          instruments
        </li>
        <li>
          They also have that large rib on the inside to make them very stiff
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:32</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The back of my head!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:44</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Side loading liquid handler nests
        </li>
        <li>
          We needed to load these instruments from the side, so I had to get
          creative with the existing threaded holes already on the instrument
          to attach these custom side loading nests
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <p>
      I've designed way more than that at Counsyl, but can't show it off due to
      my NDA.
