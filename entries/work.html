    <b>Disclaimer:</b> I've designed and done way more than this at Counsyl,
    but can't show it off due to my NDA.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I'm working at Counsyl as an Automation Engineer where I've
    done the mechanical design for almost all of the parts in their
    fully automated robotic sample processing work cell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being the main mechanical design engineer, I had all the decision making
    power for all my design projects, which was a fun experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a video that WIRED did of Counsyl's lab:

  <p>
    My role spans the entire lifecycle: brainstorming, designing,
    part selection, prototyping, manufacturing, and testing and validation.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can see some parts that I've designed:

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:16</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The nests that the 6-axis Staubli arm picks the green plate from
        </li>
        <li>
          These nests are used everywhere in the workcell
        </li>
        <li>
          The clearance (or wiggle room) of a plate in this nest is less than the
          chamfer size so that, given two nests with centered teach points, the
          plate will always sit properly in the nest after a move
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:16, 0:32, et al</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The fingers on the six-axis Staubli arms
        </li>
        <li>
          They're that funny shape so that they can fit into all the
          instruments
        </li>
        <li>
          They also have that large rib on the inside to make them very stiff
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:32</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The back of my head!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>0:44</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Side loading liquid handler nests
        </li>
        <li>
          We needed to load these instruments from the side, so I had to get
          creative with the existing threaded holes already on the instrument
          to attach these custom side loading nests
        </li>
