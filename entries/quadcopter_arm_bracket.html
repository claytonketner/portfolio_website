<h3>The Idea</h3>
  <p>This is a part that attaches to the corners of a quadcopter, and holds an arm of the quad. The club decided that taking the arms off should be tool-less so that the quad could easily be disassembled and transported.</p>

<h3>Original Design</h3>
  <p>This is the original design that one of the club members came up with.</p>
  <p>The part on the left attaches to the base, the second part slides into the first and twists to prevent it from sliding back out, and the part on the right slides into the channel to prevent the second part from rotating back and sliding out.</p>

  <div class="img-caption">
    The original assembly design that was shown to me. The first part (on the left) attaches to the base of the quadcopter. The middle part slides into the first part, and then rotates to lock it in. The third part then is inserted to prevent the second part from rotating back out.
  </div>
  <p>I immediately identified a few problems with this design. The third part (on the right) prevents the second part from vibrating out, but there isn't anything preventing the third part from coming out. Also, there were no clearances, so the parts wouldn't fit together in real life.</p>

<h3>Redesign</h3>
  <p>I tried to make the original design work, but wasn't having any luck. Because of some problems with the way the original part was designed, I decided it would be easier to just recreate the part from scratch. I basically just remade the part, but with better editability.</p>
  <p>The major difference between the their design and mine is that mine uses a threaded cap to hold everything together and prevent parts from vibrating off. Unfortunately, I had never 3D printed threads before, so the first thing to do was see if that was possible. Turns out it was - they worked on the first try!</p>

  <p>So I put the threads on my redesigned part and printed it:</p>

  <p>I also edited the part that fits inside the bracket a bit to make it more robust.</p>

    This part press fits onto the carbon fiber tube. A screw is then inserted through the middle and screwed into a captive nut on the other side. This prevents the tube from sliding out due to vibration.
