<h2>The Idea</h2>
  <p>
    This is a part that attaches to the corners of a quadcopter, and holds an
    arm of the quad. The club decided that taking the arms off should be
    tool-less so that the quad could easily be disassembled and transported.
  </p>

<h2>Original Design</h2>
  <p>
    This is the original design that one of the club members came up with.
  </p>
  <p>
    The part on the left attaches to the base, the second part slides into the
    first and twists to prevent it from sliding back out, and the part on the
    right slides into the channel to prevent the second part from rotating back
    and sliding out.
  </p>

    The original assembly design that was shown to me. The first part (on the
    left) attaches to the base of the quadcopter. The middle part slides into
    the first part, and then rotates to lock it in. The third part then is
    inserted to prevent the second part from rotating back out.
  "/>
  <p>
    I immediately identified a few problems with this design. The third part
    (on the right) prevents the second part from vibrating out, but there
    isn't anything preventing the third part from coming out. Also, there were
    no clearances, so the parts wouldn't fit together in real life.
  </p>

<h2>Redesign</h2>
  <p>
    I tried to make the original design work, but wasn't having any luck.
    Because of some problems with the way the original part was designed, I
    decided it would be easier to just recreate the part from scratch. I
    basically just remade the part, but with better editability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major difference between the their design and mine is that mine uses a
    threaded cap to hold everything together and prevent parts from vibrating
    off. Unfortunately, I had never 3D printed threads before, so the first
    thing to do was see if that was possible. Turns out it was - they worked on
    the first try!
  </p>
  <div class="multi-img row">

  </div>
  <p>
    So I put the threads on my redesigned part and printed it:

  <p>
    I also edited the part that fits inside the bracket a bit to make it more
    robust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, I had joined this club in my last semester at USC, so I
    don't know if the team used my design or not.

      This part press fits onto the carbon fiber tube. A screw is then
      inserted through the middle and screwed into a captive nut on the other
      side. This prevents the tube from sliding out due to vibration.
