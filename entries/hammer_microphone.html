<h2>The Job</h2>
  <p>
    This is my first commissioned work. A friend of mine is friends with Nick -
    the singer of a band called The Hammers. Nick wanted a sledgehammer shaped
    microphone holder as a prop to use on stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    My friend, Greg, and I worked on it together. I did the CAD work (in
    SolidWorks) and the 3D printing (on my Makergear M2), while Greg modified
    a typical microphone stand to work with the design.
  </p>

<h2>Design</h2>

      caption="The microphone Nick gave me to design around."/>
  <p>Here are some of the key design decisions that went into this project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using threaded inserts in the wooden handle to allow us to use bolts to
      attach the head.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using two bolts instead of one. One bolt would require it to be very
      tight to prevent the head from spinning, which might crack the 3D printed
      plastic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Printing it in two halves. This made for more manageable print times.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the design of the sledgehammer head to my advantage by putting
      screw holes in to attach the two halves together.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a removable microphone holder. This allows the head to accept many
      different shapes and sizes of microphone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Having nothing be permanent and everything be easily replacable. I didn't
      know what abuse this thing would be withstanding, so avoiding glue and
      making parts modular helped avoid long redesigns or reprints.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Final Design</h2>
  <p>
    Here's what the final design looks like:
  </p>

  <p>
    You can see the dovetail at the bottom that accepts the microphone holder.
    The holder is interchangable, because I figured that it would be the part
    that would require the most design iterations.</p>

<h2>Prototyping</h2>
  <p>
    I printed the microphone holder first, since it's relatively small and
    quick to print. After a few design iterations, I ended up with this:
  </p>
  <div class="multi-img row">
    <img src="/static/entries/images/hammer_microphone/holder_1.jpg"/>
    <img src="/static/entries/images/hammer_microphone/holder_2.jpg"/>
  </div>
  <p>
    I couldn't find any actual information about the taper of the microphone,
    but I made a few measurements with some calipers, and was able to make a
    pretty good fit that grips the microphone tightly. Additionally, the holder
    is thin enough to bend and conform slightly to the shape of the microphone.
  </p>

<h2>Production</h2>
  <p>
    Each half of the microphone took over four hours to print. Being able to
    print the head in two halves was a huge help here. Here's the microphone in
    one half, waiting for the other half to be printed. You can see the part of
    the stand that holds the handle. It uses a pre-made guitar stand clamp,
    because the microphone is meant to be able to be carried around just like
    a sledgehammer.

<h2>Final Product</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, the man who commissioned the work, Nick, was very happy with the
    result. The day we finished, his band actually played at a party, and it
    survived all the roughhousing with no damage! Here are some pictures
    someone took.

<h2>Difficulties</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, the hammer turned out great and is very sturdy. However, there
    were a few hiccups:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The holes in the top that the screws pass through are very large and
      visually disruptive. It would be best to cap them somehow, but I wasn't
      able to think of a great solution in the amount of time I had.
    </li>
    <li>
      Working the clearance for the removable microphone holder was a big pain.
      Even though I designed in what I thought was enough clearance, I had to
      do a lot of sanding and scraping to get it to slide into the dovetail
      slot in the head. I guess it turns out FDM isn't great for making parts
      that fit together nicely.
    </li>
  </ul>
