<h2>Class Summary</h2>
  <p>
    In this class, we learned about a bunch of different topics, including:
  </p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Sensor use</li>
    <li>Markov decision processes (MDPs)</li>
    <li>Partially observable MDPs (POMDPs)</li>
    <li>Kalman filters</li>
    <li>Particle filters</li>
    <li>SLAM and fastSLAM</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some of the algorithms learned were implemented in the lab. One of the
    assignments was to implement an interactive virtual particle filter, which
    I did using Processing. The code can be found

      on GitHub
    </a>.
