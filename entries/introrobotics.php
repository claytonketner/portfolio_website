			<h3>Class Summary</h3>
			<p>In this class, we learned about a bunch of different topics, including:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Sensor use</li>
				<li>Markov decision processes (MDPs)</li>
				<li>Partially observable MDPs (POMDPs)</li>
				<li>Kalman filters</li>
				<li>Particle filters</li>
				<li>SLAM and fastSLAM</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Some of the algorithms learned were implemented in the lab. One of the assignments was to implement an 
			interactive virtual particle filter, which I did using Processing. The code can be found 
			<a href="https://github.com/claytonketner/ParticleFilterSimulation" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h3>Video Demonstration</h3>
			<p>Here are the results of a few of the lab assignments narrated by yours truly.</p>
